# Support engineer

Support engineer is someone who’s first priority is to fix important bugs and monitor error boards.
Having this role helps other developers to be focused on their tasks.

This role is a temporal one (1 or 2 weeks), usually developers added to support engineers team once they completed a big task and need some
time to monitor results and get some more energy.

Support engineer engineers as a rule don't have product tasks in their backlog: they work on bug-fixing and reducing technical debt.
