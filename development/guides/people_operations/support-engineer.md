# Support engineer

Support engineer is someone whoâ€™s first priority is to fix important bugs and monitor error boards.
Having this role helps other developers to be focused on their tasks.

This role is a temporal one, usually developers added to support engineers team once they completed a big task and need some
time to monitor results and get some more energy.

Support engineer engineers as a rule don't have product tasks in their backlog: they work on bug-fixing and reducing technical debt.
