# Support engineer

The support engineer's first priority is to fix important bugs and monitor error boards. The main goal of this role is to help other developers to be focused on their tasks.

This role is a temporary one, usually assigned for 1 or 2 weeks at a time. Developers are often assigned the support engineer role once they have completed a big task and need some
time to monitor results and recover their energy.

As a general rule, support engineers don't have product tasks in their backlog - they work on bug-fixing and reducing technical debt.

## Hints

In order to be efficient as a support engineer, you need to set your tools up to inform your about errors.

### Slack

Channels that are often muted to increase your productivity, should be un-muted:

-   `#errors--production` and other `errors--*` channels
-   `#js-errors--production`

Please mark handled reports by ✔️ reaction so your colleagues will see you haven’t missed it.

### NewRelic

Just regularly check (at least once a day) the error trends.
