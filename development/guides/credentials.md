# Credentials

We use [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) as our password manager.

## Question: Where can I find the security document which contains the credentials?

All credentials including site logins, server credentials, API credentials, along with special notes/instructions on how to access them, etc. are stored in LastPass. Just ask for access.
