# Coordinate Efforts

![](../images/hero-coordination.svg)

When you have a grand global [vision](/achieve-purpose/vision.md) and a [mission](/achieve-purpose) to achieve that vision with the highest possible quality at the lowest possible cost for millions of people, you are only going to succeed with fantastic coordination.

The IxDF achieves this by hiring unicorn team members, creating a high-performance culture and coordinating everything with the help of frameworks like scrum, agile and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).
