# The IxDF Process

![](../images/hero-process.svg)

To achieve our [Mission and Vision](/about/purpose.md), the IxDF [develops our own software](/development), [designs our products](/product/product-process.md) and creates lots of learning content. To keep ourselves aligned within and across teams, we use Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
