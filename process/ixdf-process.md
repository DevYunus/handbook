# Coordination

![](../images/hero-coordination.svg)

To achieve our [Mission and Vision](/about/purpose.md), we [develop software](/development), [design products](/product/product-process.md) and create lots of learning content. To keep ourselves aligned within and across teams, we use Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
