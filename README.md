# IxDF System

![](./images/hero-all.svg)

To accomplish our Mission and achieve our Vision efficiently, the IxDF relies on processes and tools.

The most widely-used is our [OKR Process](/process/our-process.md) that helps us to work together and get things done within and across teams. The
OKR Process is supported by our [Product Process](/product/product-process.md) which is how we design and and deliver new things and our [Development
Process](/development) which is how we build and maintain them.
